freetype-sys [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PistonDevelopers/freetype-sys.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PistonDevelopers/freetype-sys) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/cx6i2r1ibroywo2q?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jhasse/freetype-sys)
============

Low level bindings for the FreeType font library.

## C headers

If your Rust project includes C code that needs to interface with FreeType, the
environment variable `DEP_FREETYPE_INCLUDE` will be exported to its build
script, giving the path in which the FreeType include files may be found. This
path may be in the system or it may be inside this crateâ€™s `$OUT_DIR`, depending
on whether it was necessary to build the FreeType library locally or not.

## For windows users

### -pc-windows-gnu
In order to easily setup freetype just get MSYS2 and install either the `mingw-w64-x86_64-freetype` or `mingw-w64-i686-freetype` package and then use Rust from within the correct mingw shell of MSYS2.

More information on setting up MSYS2 for Rust can be found in [the Rust readme](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust#building-on-windows)

### -pc-windows-msvc
Prebuilt libraries for freetype are available [here](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/binaries).

Then in the root of your project, in one of the parent directories, or in your home directory, create a .cargo directory. This directory should contain a `config` file that contains the following snippet:

```toml
[target.i686-pc-windows-msvc.freetype]
rustc-link-search = ["C:\\Path\\To\\binaries\\i686"]
rustc-link-lib = ["freetype"]

[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.freetype]
rustc-link-search = ["C:\\Path\\To\\binaries\\x86_64"]
rustc-link-lib = ["freetype"]
```

For more informations, check [the official Cargo documentation](http://doc.crates.io/build-script.html#overriding-build-scripts).
